**Welcome to my Cyber Security and OSINT Journey!**

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my little corner of GitHub where I document my adventures in the world of cybersecurity and OSINT (Open Source Intelligence). I'm just an average person with a keen interest in learning about digital security and how information can be gathered from publicly available sources.

### About Me
I might be an unknown face in the cybersecurity community, but I'm passionate about learning and exploring new things. My background might not scream "tech expert," but hey, everyone starts somewhere, right? So, why not join me on this journey as I delve into the fascinating world of cybersecurity and OSINT?

### What's This Repository About?
This repository is essentially my digital journal. Here, you'll find a mishmash of notes, resources, tools, and maybe even some occasional rants as I navigate my way through understanding cybersecurity concepts and experimenting with OSINT techniques. 

### What to Expect
